# Bot Framework Setup

In this lab, we will setup our Visual Studio .NET Bot Framework development environment.  This includes the following:

1.	Installing the Bot Emulator (used for testing our bot locally)
2.	Adding the Visual Studio 2017 Bot Framework project template
3.	Create and running our first *Hello World* bot project
4.	A quick review of the Bot Builder SDK for .NET

> Note, the following labs will require Visual Studio 2017 for Windows

*	GroupMe
*	Facebook
*	Kik
*	Slack
