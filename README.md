# Microsoft .NET Bot Framework Hands On Labs
Welcome!  I'm a big fan of the Microsoft .NET Bot Framework and bot development in general (there just fun to write)!  Therefore, I decided to buckle down and create a series of hands-on-labs as an end-to-end guide to building delightful experiences using the Microsoft .NET Bot Framework.  Throughout these labs, we'll be building a conversational bot that helps users find restaurants and make reservations.  Here's a quick example of what we'll be creating:

The content is broken up into 8 separate labs.  Each lab builds upon the previous, so it's highly recommended to walk through them in order.  That being said, if you're impatient, I've added *starter* projects for each lab.  

[Lab 1 - Setup](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%201%20-%20Setup) walks through the setup of your Visual Studio development environment as well as the installation of the Microsoft Bot Emulator (priceless when it comes to debugging your application).

[Lab 2 - LUIS](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%202%20-%20LUIS) provides a detailed walk through of Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligence Service (aka LUIS), which allows you to integrate natural language processing into your bot.  An absolute must for building conversational experiences.

[Lab 3 - Integrate LUIS](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL) demonstrates how we integrate with LUIS through the .NET Bot Framework and as well as state management within our bot applications.

[Lab 4 - Bot Builder](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%204%20-%20Bot%20Builder) provides a conceptual overview of the .NET Bot Framework and some of the critical components you'll want to become familiar.

[Lab 5 - Dialogs](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%205%20-%20Dialogs) Outlines some general bot design patterns that I've found to be successful when working with the Bot Framework.

[Lab 6 - LUIS all the way down](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%206%20-%20Luis%20all%20the%20way%20down) outlines some design patterns for integrating LUIS and natural language processing throughout the entire life cycle of a bot conversation.

[Lab 7 - Scorables](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%207%20-%20Scorables) demonstrates global message handlers for 
addressing common commands within your bot application.

[Lab 8 - Azure Bot Service](https://github.com/gtewksbury/Microsoft-Bot-Framework-HOL/tree/master/lab%208%20-%20Azure%20Bot%20Services) walks through the process of deploying and hosting your bot logic within a reliable and durable Azure environment.

So, if that seems like your particular brand of Vodka, you're in the right place!  I'm definitely interested in feedback, so let me know if there's anything I can do to improve or continue to grow these tutorials!
